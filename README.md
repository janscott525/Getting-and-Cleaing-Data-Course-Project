# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The porject for this class asked us to download data from the internet analyze it meeting cetrtain data analytics criteria. The file run_analysis.R contained in this repository is the R Programming script file for this project. The data is from Samsung and is human activity data captured by smart devices, Information about the data can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data was separated into several data files - inlcuding test and trainign data. The following were the data analytics criteria that the class project required:
1.Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The above list of criteria were converted to R functionality in the R script file listed above: run_analysis.R, which includes comments explaining the functionality of each section of the code. See the Code Book file in this repository for variable definitions.
